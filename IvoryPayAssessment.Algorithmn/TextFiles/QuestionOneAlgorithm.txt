THE STEPS

(1) Initialize an empty dictionary to store the count of each sock color.
(2) Iterate through the array of sock colors:
    (a) If the color is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
    (b) If the color is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.
(3) Iterate through the dictionary and for each color count:
    (a) Calculate the number of pairs for that color by dividing the count by 2 (integer division).
    (b) Add the number of pairs to a running total.
(4) Return the total number of pairs.



ALGORITHM
def SockMerchant(socks):
    sockCounts = {}  # Dictionary to store counts of each sock color
    
    # Count occurrences of each sock color
    for sock in socks:
        if sock in sockCounts:
            sockCounts[sock] += 1
        else:
            sockCounts[sock] = 1
    
    # Count pairs for each color
    totalPairs = 0
    for count in sockCounts.values():
        totalPairs += count // 2  # Integer division to get pairs
    
    return totalPairs

# Example usage:
socks = [10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 30, 50, 10, 20]  # Example array of sock colors
print("Number of pairs of socks with matching colors:", count_sock_pairs(socks))
